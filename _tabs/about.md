I'm Luís Felipe, a Computer Science undergraduate student at [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/). I previously worked as a data science intern at [SYDLE](https://www.sydle.com/).

I also worked as a research student under the guidance of Professor [Renato Vimieiro](https://dcc.ufmg.br/professor/renato-vimieiro/) at [SPEED Lab](https://dcc.ufmg.br/speed/) on a project about classifying heart diseases using electrocardiograms. You can learn more about the project in this post.

## Interests

I am passionate about my studies and career. Math and Computer Science are incredibly beautiful fields, and I dedicate a lot of time to learning more about them.

Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy watching TV shows, movies, and [anime](https://myanimelist.net/profile/lframosferreira).

I am also an avid cuber! My main cube is the Moyu RS3M 2020. My personal best for a single 3x3x3 solve is 7.03 seconds, and my average for five solves is 11.03 seconds. I am working hard to achieve a sub-10 average for five solves.

Additionally, I love football. My favorite team is [Cruzeiro](https://www.cruzeiro.com.br/). I watch many matches from various championships, such as the Brasileirão, Libertadores, and Champions League.
