As stated by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming), competitive programming is a mind sport involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. A programming competition generally involves the host presenting a set of logical or mathematical problems, also known as puzzles or challenges, to the contestants (who can vary in number from tens or even hundreds to several thousand). Contestants are required to write computer programs capable of solving these problems.
